Weighted Round Robin or Weighted Least Connections
Both Weighted Round Robin and Weighted Least Connections are extensions of the basic Round Robin and Least Connections algorithms, respectively. In these weighted methods, each server is assigned a weight based on its capacity or some other criteria. Servers with higher weights will receive a proportionally larger number of requests.

Trade-offs
Better Resource Utilization:

These weighted methods allow for more intelligent distribution of requests, especially in a heterogeneous environment where servers have different capacities.

Adaptability: Both methods can be more adaptable to real-world scenarios where all servers are not equally capable or where different types of requests consume different amounts of resources.

Fairness and Priority: The weight assignment can also be used to prioritize certain servers over others, providing more control over the traffic distribution.
Scalability: These weighted methods can be more effective as you scale your environment. When you add a new, more powerful server, you can simply assign it a higher weight instead of reconfiguring the entire system.
Hybrid Scenarios: Weighted methods can be useful in hybrid or cloud scenarios where you might have a mix of on-premises and cloud servers with varying capabilities.
Drawbacks


Complexity: The added layer of weights increases the complexity of managing and configuring the load balancer.

Manual Tuning: Deciding the appropriate weights for each server often requires manual tuning and a deep understanding of the workload characteristics and server capabilities.

Resource Monitoring: For Weighted Least Connections, the load balancer has to not only keep track of active connections but also needs to consider the weights in real-time, increasing the computational overhead.

Inefficiency in Weight Allocation: If weights are not set properly, it can lead to inefficient use of resources. For example, assigning a too-high weight to a low-capacity server can overwhelm it.
