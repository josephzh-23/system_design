 In this method, the load balancer maintains a record of the number of active connections for each server in the pool.

Pro
1. More Intelligent Routing: Unlike Round Robin, Least Connections takes into account the current server load (at least in terms of active connections),

Better for Varying Request Complexity:

Drawbacks

Drawbacks
Unaware of Task Complexity: While the Least Connections method considers the number of active connections, it doesnâ€™t account for the computational complexity of the tasks each server is handling. A server could have fewer but more resource-intensive tasks, and yet still receive new requests.

Higher Overhead: Maintaining a real-time count of active connections for each server incurs more computational overhead compared to simpler algorithms like Round Robin.
