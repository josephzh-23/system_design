The link above kind of explains it but can still see below here:

1. Add more brokers to the cluster
-   Install Kafka software on the new machines and ensure they can
 communicate with the existing Kafka cluster and ZooKeeper ensemble.


2.Reparitition existing topics:
Use Kafka's partition reassignment tool to rebalance partition
s across the new and existing brokers, ensuring an even distribution of partitions.

3. Monitor the manage the cluster after scaling

Regularly monitor the performance metrics of the Kafka cluster,
such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization,
using monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or other Kafka-specific monitoring solutions.
