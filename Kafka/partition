Why is partition so important?

Topics are divided into several partitions,
Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages, and it acts as a data shard within the topic.

1. Partitions allow messages to be processed independently by multiple consumers while
maintaining the order of messages with the same key.


2.Each topic -> has many partitions

3. One partition -> a single consumer here

4. Partition count: The total number of partitions within a cluster should be < 200,000. It is also advised to
 maintain up to 4,000 partitions per broker
