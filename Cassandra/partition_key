Partition key:

One or more columns that are used to determine what partition the row is in.

We'll discuss partitioning of data later in this deep-dive.


Clustering key:
 Zero or more columns that are used to determine the sorted order of rows in a table.
  Data ordering is important depending on one's data modeling needs, so Cassandra gives users control over this via the clustering keys.
