What does it mean? When updating a data, EU server and US servers should both get the ++ in the c value here
1.	So when you have multi copies of data


	You can make a node server your leader, then rest will then be follower, and then using the 2 phase commit
to write the transaction

	When leader gets a update, you send a prepare request to your followers, your followers give you an acknowledgement that, Hey, yes, I got the prepare request. And when you get these acknowledgements, you ask your followers to commit a transaction here.


		What if the commit msg fails in one of the slaves?
	1.	We willl retry and then while the request is going through, we will block all get operations, so the availability is low but consistency is high here.
