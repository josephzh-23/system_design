These 2 above really makes sense  here
ðŸ”¹ Vertical partitioning: it means some columns are moved to new tables. Each table contains the same number of
 rows but fewer columns (see diagram below).

ðŸ”¹ Horizontal partitioning (often called sharding): it divides a table into multiple smaller tables.
Each table is a separate data store, and it contains the same number of columns, but fewer rows (see diagram below).
