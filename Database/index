What's index here


    Indexing is a data structure technique that allows you to quickly retrieve records from a database file. An Index is a small table having only two columns.


      The first column comprises a copy of the primary or candidate key of a table. Its second column contains a set of pointers for holding the address of the disk block where that specific key-value stored.
