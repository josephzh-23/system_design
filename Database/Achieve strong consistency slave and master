Q: How can we achieve strong consistency between the master and slave databases?

	A: WAL (Write-Ahead-Logging), a well-known and important technology in database, is needed for this purpose-. When the system updates the operation write logs (Oracle Redo Log and MySQL Binlog among others) or commits a transaction, one should first ensure the flushing of the logs generated by the transaction to the disk. This would ensure no data loss occurs.


The method for achieving the strong data consistency between the master and slave databases is also simple:
	•	When you commit a transaction, it initiates two log writing operations: the first one to write the log to the ephemeral disk, and the other to synchronize the log to the slave database and ensure it is saved to the disk

	•	The master database will return the response to the application only upon the successful return of the two operations, at which point the transaction commitment is successful.
