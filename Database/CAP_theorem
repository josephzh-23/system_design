What is CAP theorem?


CAP(Consistency-Availability-Partition Tolerance) theorem says that a distributed system cannot
guarantee C, A and P simultaneously. It can at max provide any 2 of the 3 guarantees.
Let us understand this with the help of a distributed database system.

•	Consistency:  all queries should retrieve the same result for a highly consistent database

In a parking garage system, this means that
no two people should be able to resver the same spot at the same time)


•	Availability: The databases cannot have downtime and should be available and responsive always.

•	Partition Tolerance: The database system should be functioning despite the communication becoming unstable.
