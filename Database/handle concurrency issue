Concurrency issues
	When multiple transactions execute concurrently in an uncontrolled or unrestricted manner, then it might lead to several problems. These problems are commonly referred to as concurrency problems in a database environment.


2. Optimistic locking

		1)	A new column called “version” is added to the database table.

	  2) Before a user modifies a database row, the application reads the version number of the row.

		3)	When the user updates the row, the application increases the version number by 1 and writes it back to the database.

		4) A database validation check is put in place; the next version number should exceed the current version number by 1. The transaction aborts if the validation fails and the user tries again from step 2.

		Definitely more scalable then pessimistic locking


3.Pessimistic Locking

		pessimistic locking really locks the database
