Atomicity

    1. Think of a financial transaction, for example. You are paying a friend $250 for a holiday you are going on. The whole transaction would consist of the money leaving your account and arriving in the recipient’s account. If there was no atomicity, it is possible that money leaves your account but doesn’t arrive at the other end, resulting in you being debited the money but still owing the recipient.


Consistency

  For example, will expect your balance to be positive. So if you tried to withdraw more money than you have available, this would break a constraint and fail, rolling back all operations in that transaction.

Isolation

  imagine you have a bank balance of $200 and you try to withdraw $100 at an ATM. At the same time, a standing order you have set up comes out for $100. With isolation, these transactions can occur concurrently, ensuring that your ending balance is $0, not $100, because the transactions impacted each other.
